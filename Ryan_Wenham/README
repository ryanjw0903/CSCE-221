Pseudocode :
I have a header file for the declarations and a cpp source file that has implentation of the functions
Inside the Stress_ball class there is two enumeranated classes for size and color. We had to make
a constructor that would randomly select from those two classes and output it. In addition
Had to build a an function to mannually select the color and size and a overload operator to compare any
two stress balls.

Tested:
I tested it but running in muitple times to make sure the colors and size where 100% random and there
no sort of pattern. I also ran it on my clions own complier and the putty many times to make sure it worked on both
To handle any errors i would ask the code to output what is seeing right there at that point in time to see the issue
that is up, unless the debugger told me exactly what it is.

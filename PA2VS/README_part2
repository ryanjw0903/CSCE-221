Problems: None 

Pseudocode: 
For the templated version i took the int base verison in part and add the templated typename T. 
This required me to move everything to the the header file. In the headr file i had to celcre typename T
for each memeber function outside the class. In addtion do <T> for the decalration of the class and for every DDListnode and DLList.


Testesd: 
Used the test that where given and built 4 of my own to test insert after/before and 
remove after/before.

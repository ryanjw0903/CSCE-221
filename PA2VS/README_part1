Problems: None 

Pseudocode:

defined to allow us to dynamiccaly make new nodes an make them all linked. In the class we defined
many functions to insert and remove nodes from the linked list.  


Testesd: 
Used the test that where given and built 4 of my own to test insert after/before and 
remove after/before.
